            sensory organs is collected through sight. Data visualization uses
            visual elements to summarize and depict a large volume of data. It
            enables viewers to observe a great quantity of information at once
            that they would not be able to notice at a glance. Furthermore,
            everyone regardless of data literacy may readily discover data
            insights based on visual patterns, eliminating the need for
            mathematical and statistical skills for data analysis. Hence, it
            broadens the scope of data utilization.
